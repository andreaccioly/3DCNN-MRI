Cerebral Microbleeds (CMB) diagnostic of 3D SWI-MRI using Spatial Pyramid Pooling modified 3D CNNs
This work is based on the work of Dou et al.(2016) (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7403984)
The goal is to improve the 3D CNN model implementing a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) model to overcome the 
constant size constraint imposed by Fully Connected (FC) layers.
